## 1. Why Docker?
* Traditional deployment was too complex and took too long
	* set up hardware, os, etc...
* With Docker, you can manage it with just simple commands

### Standardized Application Packaging
* Same packaging for all types of applications*
### Multi-Platform Support
* Local Machine, Data Center, Cloud
### Isolation
* Containers are isolated from one another
* 
### Simplified Deployement
* OS, Programming language, Hardware does not matter
* Just create a Docker Image, and run it

### Docker Image
* contains everything you need to run your app
* OS, App runtime(JDK, Python, ...), code and dependencies
### Docker Container
* You can run it the same way everywhere*
