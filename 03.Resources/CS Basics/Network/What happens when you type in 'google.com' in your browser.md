When you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and hit enter, several steps occur behind the scenes, involving various protocols and systems. Here's a simplified step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Domain Name System (DNS) Resolution**:
   - Your browser sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver (usually provided by your ISP or a third-party DNS service).
   - The DNS resolver looks up the IP address associated with the domain name "www.google.com" by querying authoritative DNS servers.
   - Once the IP address is resolved, it's returned to your browser.

2. **Establishing a TCP Connection**:
   - Your browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the IP address obtained in the previous step, typically on port 443 for HTTPS.
   - This involves a three-way handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK.

3. **SSL/TLS Handshake**:
   - If the URL begins with "https://" (as in the case of Google), an SSL/TLS handshake occurs to establish a secure connection.
   - During the handshake, the browser and the server negotiate encryption algorithms, exchange keys, and verify the server's authenticity.

4. **HTTP Request**:
   - Once the secure connection is established, your browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server for the specific resource ("/" in this case).

5. **Server Processing**:
   - The server receives the request and processes it. In the case of Google, it might involve querying databases, executing scripts, or accessing cached resources.

6. **HTTP Response**:
   - The server sends back an HTTP response containing the requested resource, typically including HTML content for the initial webpage.

7. **Rendering**:
   - Your browser receives the response and begins rendering the webpage, interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Additional requests may be made for resources like images, stylesheets, or scripts referenced in the HTML.

8. **Displaying the Page**:
   - Finally, your browser displays the rendered webpage to you, allowing you to interact with it, perform searches, or navigate to other pages.

Throughout this process, there's a lot more happening behind the scenes, including various optimizations and security checks to ensure a smooth and secure browsing experience.
